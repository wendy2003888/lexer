This is a common c++ language file.
You can run it just as other C++ programs.
You should create a file called ‘in.txt’ and ‘out.txt’ at the same root directory of ‘lexer.cpp’
and then the result will be generated in the ‘out.txt’.
Or you can comment out the code 
	“ freopen("in.txt","r",stdin);	//读入文件
	  freopen("out.txt","w",stdout);	//写入文件  ”

There is an example file ‘in.txt’ and the result ‘’out.txt .
